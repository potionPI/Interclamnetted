		<p>One look at this site and you'll find that it looks rather sparse... That's because the site was created solely with the goal of making a pretty looking site while playing around with Jekyll.</p>
		<p>To be honest, I don't think I managed to use Jekyll all that well though.</p>
		<p>It's a site that's more or less organized, but could definitely be improved.</p>
		<p>You can download some wallpapers if you go to the "Content" pearl, if you don't want to leave empty handed.</p>
		<p>Anyway, take a look at the github repository for all the code.</p>
